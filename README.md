This game is nothing special. It is a weak demonstration at a game engine built from scratch and I appreciate it for what it is. Granted, it's not perfect and not in anyway complete but it is there.

Title: Catch!

The game and engine itself was a lot of weeks (and hours of help) trying to learn the basics of game engine building and development of a game system that is playable and interactive. Main features of my game and engine are:
Input
Audio (although that broke a while ago)
Collision
A pretty island and tree... for some reason.

It says I should add images but I have no idea how.

Only instructions: play and move?

Known issues: the sprite runner does not work at all for some reason. Also there is like no gameplay functionality.

Anyway that is all. I know it's nothing special but it was a lot and I'm proud of what it is. Not like a A+ proud, but a mediocre B...
